Intuition:
To maximize total happiness, we should always pick the children with the highest happiness first.
However, each time we select a child, the happiness of the next selected child decreases by 1.

So the best strategy is:
    Pick the largest happiness values early, before they get reduced too much.


Approach:
Sort the happiness array.
Start picking from the largest values.
For each selected child:
    Add max(0, happiness[i] − turn) to the answer
    Increase turn (number of children already picked).
Stop after selecting k children.


Complexity:
Time complexity:O(NLogN)
Space complexity:O(1)

Code:
class Solution {
    public long maximumHappinessSum(int[] happiness, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(happiness);
        long ans = 0;
        int turn = 0;

        for (int i = happiness.length - 1; i >= 0 && k > 0; i--) {
            ans += Math.max(0, happiness[i] - turn);
            turn++;
            k--;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
