Intuition:
We want to store all apples using the minimum number of boxes.
To reduce the number of boxes used, we should use the largest capacity boxes first.
This is a greedy strategy: bigger boxes can hold more apples in one go.


Approach:
Calculate total apples by summing all values in the apple array.
Sort the capacity array in ascending order.
Start picking boxes from the largest capacity (end of the sorted array).
Keep subtracting box capacity from total apples until all apples are placed.
Count how many boxes were used.


Complexity:
Time complexity:O(Mlogm)
Space complexity:O(1)



class Solution {
    public int minimumBoxes(int[] apple, int[] capacity) {
        int n = apple.length;
        int m = capacity.length;

        Arrays.sort(capacity);
        int totalApple = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            totalApple += apple[i];
        }

        int ans = m;
        while(totalApple > 0){
            totalApple -= capacity[ans-1];
            ans--;
        }
        return m-ans;
    }
}
