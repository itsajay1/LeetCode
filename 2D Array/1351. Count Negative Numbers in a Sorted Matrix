Intuition:
    The matrix is sorted in non-increasing order both row-wise and column-wise.
    So from a smart starting position, we can eliminate an entire row or column in one step instead of checking every cell.

Approach:
    Start from the top-right corner.

    If the current value is negative:
        All values below it in the same column are also negative.
        Count all of them at once and move left.

    If the current value is positive or zero:
        All values to the left in the same row are positive.
        Skip the row and move down.

    Repeat until you move out of the matrix.

Complexity:
    Time complexity:O(n+m)
    Space complexity:O(1)



class Solution {
    public int countNegatives(int[][] grid) {
        int rows = grid.length;
        int cols = grid[0].length;

        int row = 0;
        int col = cols-1;
        int count = 0;

        while(row < rows && col >= 0){
            if(grid[row][col] < 0){
                count +=rows-row;
                col--;
            }
            else{
                row++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
